# Plutus Accountant Automation Suite — Milestone 1

Automates the monthly bank statement → Excel pipeline for an accountant's practice.

Upload a Barclays bank statement (CSV, PDF or XLSX), and the system:
1. Parses every transaction
2. Assigns UK financial year labels automatically
3. Categorises each transaction using a rule layer + Claude AI
4. Appends all rows to the Excel workbook's RAW tab with live formulas
5. Rebuilds the Analysis pivot with SUMIFS formulas

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Download |
|------|---------|----------|
| Python | 3.10 or higher | https://www.python.org/downloads/ |
| Node.js | 18 or higher | https://nodejs.org/ |
| VS Code | Latest | https://code.visualstudio.com/ |

---

## Setup (one-time)

### 1. Create the virtual environment and install Python packages

```
cd "Plutus Accountant Automation Suite"
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Add your Anthropic API key

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your key:

```
copy .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace the placeholder:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...your-real-key-here...
```

### 3. Install frontend dependencies

```
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

## Running the project

You need **two terminals open at the same time**.

**Terminal 1 — Backend API (port 8000)**
```
cd "Plutus Accountant Automation Suite"
venv\Scripts\uvicorn api.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend (port 5173)**
```
cd "Plutus Accountant Automation Suite\frontend"
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at: **http://localhost:5173**

---

## How to use

1. Open **http://localhost:5173**
2. Drag and drop a Barclays bank statement onto the upload zone, or click to browse
3. Wait for the progress steps to complete (Parsing → AI Categorisation → Writing Excel)
4. Click **Download Excel** to get the processed workbook
5. Click **Process another statement** or the back arrow to process another file

## Supported input formats

| Format | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `.csv` | Barclays online banking → Download → CSV |
| `.pdf` | Barclays online banking → Download → PDF |
| `.xlsx` | Barclays online banking → Download → Excel |

> The output is always an `.xlsx` file — your master workbook with the new rows appended.

## Column layout written to RAW tab (A–M)

| Col | Name | Content |
|-----|------|---------|
| A | No | Sequential row number |
| B | SA | UK FY label e.g. `FY24` |
| C | ACC | FY range e.g. `24/25` |
| D | Date | Transaction date |
| E | Subcategory | Bank's own transaction type |
| F | Memo | Transaction description |
| G | Paid in | Credit amount |
| H | Paid out | Debit amount |
| I | Balance | Statement balance (blank for CSV/XLSX) |
| J | NET | Formula `=G-H` |
| K | Balance UC | Running balance formula chain |
| L | Check UC | Formula `=I-K` (only when balance present) |
| M | UC Category | Category assigned by the system |

---

## UK Financial Year logic

- Runs **6 April to 5 April**
- Example: transaction on 2 May 2024 → `FY24`, `24/25`
- Example: transaction on 5 April 2024 → `FY23`, `23/24`
- Example: transaction on 6 April 2024 → `FY24`, `24/25`

---

## Category list

The system categorises every transaction into one of these fixed categories:

```
Accountancy, Bank charges, Car Insurance, Charging, Company Car,
DLA, Directors salary, Donation, Entertainment, Equipment,
Gym, HMRC, In/Out, Income, Insurance, Interest income,
Investment, Lunch, Mobile phone, Mother Salary, Parking,
Penalty fee, Petrol, Postage, Professional, Professional fees - College,
Refund, Subscription, Sundry, Taxes for mother, Taxi, Train, Travel
```

Known payees are matched by rules instantly (no API cost). Unknown transactions are sent to Claude AI. Results are cached so repeated payees are never re-sent.

---

## Security notes

- Your Anthropic API key is stored only in the `.env` file — never committed to version control
- Bank account numbers, sort codes, IBANs and account holder names are **never sent to the AI**
- Only the transaction description, subcategory and credit/debit direction are sent for categorisation
- All processing happens on your local machine — no data is sent to any external server except Anthropic's API for categorisation

---

## CLI usage (optional, without the frontend)

You can also run the pipeline directly from the command line:

```
# CSV
venv\Scripts\python main.py --input "Samples\May 24.csv"

# PDF
venv\Scripts\python main.py --input "Samples\Statement 03-MAY-24.pdf"

# Custom template or output path
venv\Scripts\python main.py --input "path\to\statement.csv" --template "path\to\template.xlsx" --output "path\to\output.xlsx"

# Append to RAW (3) instead of RAW (2)
venv\Scripts\python main.py --input "statement.csv" --sheet "RAW (3)"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No transactions found in the uploaded file"**
- Make sure the file is a genuine Barclays export, not a manually created spreadsheet
- Check the file opens correctly in Excel/a text editor

**"No API key – marking X txns as Sundry"**
- Your `.env` file is missing or the key is invalid
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your key

**Backend won't start**
- Make sure you're in the project root and the venv is activated
- Run `venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt` again

**Frontend shows blank page**
- Make sure the backend is running on port 8000 before opening the frontend
- Check the browser console for errors (F12)

**`npm install` or `npm run dev` doesn't run (blocked by PowerShell execution policy / administrator permissions)**

If you see an error about running scripts being disabled on this system, PowerShell is blocking the `npm.ps1` script. In the same terminal, use `npm.cmd` instead — it bypasses the blocked `npm.ps1` file:

For install:
```
npm.cmd install
```

To run the frontend:
```
npm.cmd run dev
```
